# Preface:
I didn’t expect to take three courses this semester. Due to the withdrawal of Physics(I)(II), I had to retake physics(I)(II). Moreover, I wanted to take Computer Graphics in first semester sophomore year; nevertheless, the prerequisite of Computer Graphics is Basic Programming, but I hadn’t passed the subjects. Thus, I chose Physics(I)(II) and Basic Programming this semester.

# Core Subjects in CS:
## Basic Programming(基礎程式設計)
Semester:2020–Summer (DCP)

Course contents: Test

Grading Policy:

    Pass one of the quiz in the semester.
    The full mark is 6, and the pass mark is 2.4.

Comment:

I almost failed the subject because I didn’t fully prepare for the test. At the beginning, I glimpsed the old exams. They seemed to be simple, so I didn’t prepare for the exam. However, when I actually had a test, my program often took excessive time to execute. In addition, I also neglected the details of the question. Thus, I didn’t pass the quiz at first. After memorizing a lot of solutions, I afterwards achieved the pass mark in the second quiz. Overall, it is difficult to pass without practicing.

## Physics (I)(物理(一))
Semester:2020–Summer

Lecturer:劉宗哲

Course contents: Unit, force, heat and wave

Grading Policy:

    Homework*4 (50%)
    Midterm exam (50%)
    Final exam (100%)
    Bonus: Answer the question in class.

Comment:

The grading policy of this course is amazing. First of all, the full mark is 200, which is twice as much as 100. It sounds unrealistic, but it is real. Additionally, he often asked people a lot of questions in the class. If students interacted with teacher, students could get one point per response. I remembered that I answered 34 questions, and I got 92 without final exam. In conclusion, it is a weird course.

## Physics (II)(物理(二))

Semester:2020–Summer

Lecturer:杜建銘

Course contents: Electricity, magnetism, light and quantum

Grading Policy:

    Homework*2 (30%)
    Midterm exam (35%)
    Final exam (35%)
    Bonus: Answer the question in class.

Comment:

Although the workloads in this class are light, it is a little difficult to get a good grade in the course. In fact, the contents which he taught are simple, but the exams which he designed are tough. Without additional practice, students could not cope with the complicated problem during exam. Therefore, the subject is only suitable for diligent students.
